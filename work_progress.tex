\section{Phase 2: Problem Statement}

We have anlysed the problem at hand inorder to improve how our system has to function in all the respects.

\section{Phase 3: System study}

We have been studying the existing system and finding out what we can adapt from them into our project inorder to improve how it works in both better resolution of images as well as faster way to generate images.

\section{Phase 4: Implementation}

We have been working on designing the final implementation of the research we have been on so far. We have been able to condense the research we have done so far into a simple and elegent solution that we can implement and has started with it.
