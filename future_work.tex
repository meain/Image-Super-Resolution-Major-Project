\chapter{Future work}

The implemented system of image super resolution as of now is a good and stable platform for us to build future tools on top of this. We can have secific tools develeoped on top of this as well as make it a much more special purpose tool by adapting necessary changes such as selected dataset and image pre processing.

We do shoot a lot of blurry and generally bad images in our phone. We can use our system to provode a simple and intutivie process to change all those images into a better quality image. Another specific use case to which the project can be adapted to is the retrieval of more information from older and degraded photos. It will help us to better understand the historic photos.

We can also adapt the system to a specific use case, ie using it for images of text. This is a very important use of this project as it is hard to understand blurry text, but with this we can make use of image super resolution to make the text readable.
