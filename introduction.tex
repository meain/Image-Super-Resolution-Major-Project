\chapter{Introduction}

We in the current days, with the ever increasing number of phones which have cameras take a lot more photos than we used to take in the past. But the main issue with the photos is that a lot of them that we take using our phones are of very low resolution since phone cameras even though has evolved a lot still has a lot of way to go when it comes to high resolution images as the camera technology is not that advanced just yet and also due to the fact that we have to shrink the cameras into a small form factor so as to make it fit into a small device like a phone. 

Our project proposes a way in which we can improve the image clarity with the use of neural networks so that it allows us to have sharper images with more detail. We use neural networks to learn a feature representation of the image and try to reconstruct an enhanced image from the condensed representation.

It also is highly useful when we have images from the past which could not have been taken using better cameras as they didn't even exist back then.
